# Student_Score_Prediction-ML
Machine Learning project that predicts students final scores using Linear Regression based on study hours, previous Scores, and Sleep hours

📌 Project Overview
This project predicts a student's final exam score based on academic and lifestyle factors such as:
Hours Studied
Previous Exam Score
Sleep Hours
The model uses Linear Regression to analyze patterns and generate predictions.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Jupyter Notebook

🤖 Machine Learning Model
Linear Regression
Train/Test Split (80/20)
Performance Evaluation using R² Score

📈 Model Performance
R² Score: (Add your actual value here)
The model demonstrates strong predictive performance on test data.

🚀 Features
Data preparation using Pandas
Train/Test data splitting
Linear Regression model training
Model evaluation (R² Score)
User input prediction system
Visualization (Actual vs Predicted scores)

🧠 How It Works
Dataset is created using study-related factors.
Data is split into training and testing sets.
Linear Regression model is trained.
Predictions are made on test data.
Model accuracy is evaluated using R² Score.
Users can input new data to predict final score.

📊 Sample Prediction
Example:
Input:
Hours Studied: 2
Previous Score: 30
Sleep Hours: 7
Output: Predicted Final Score: 27.94

📚 Learning Outcomes
